# Real Estate Market Analysis

We analyse real estate market in San Francisco from 2010 to 2016 using python visualing techniques.

We especaiily employ interactive charts so that readers can easily spot and focus on information they are searching.
For this purpose we mainly use Plotly and hvplot

This analysis consists of the following two jupyter files.
 
**- rental_analysis.ipynb**
**- dashboard_analysis.ipynb**

In the former we walk you though each analysis using following data on San Francisco real estate market.

**- Sale price per square foot**
**- Building unit number**
**- Gross rent**

We look at these data for each neignborhood from 2010 to 2016
